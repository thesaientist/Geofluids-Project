# Geofluids-Project

Repository for a small final project in graduate level class GEO382D: Crustal Geofluids, taught by Dr. Peter Flemings. The project deals with direction of fracture propagation and factors affecting this direction.

This repository consists of python modules to generate uniform meshes for use in Peridigm simulations of fractures, as well as input files for the simulator.
